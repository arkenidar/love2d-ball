# ball : simple gravity , bouncing and rotative friction

## usage instructions

use the mouse or touch to grab and drag the ball ,
to make it bounce and rotate by friction .
simulated gravity is there also .
also energy decay is there to make it stop .
so the bouncing stops by decay ,
and roto-traslation also similarly .

## requires love2d "runtime"

love2d runtime should be installed .
[download and install love2d](https://www.love2d.org/) .
installing includes having the "love" binary executable in PATH ( for example Windows PATH or Debian PATH ) .
BUT a love2d.exe file is bundled for Windows users , run it somehow with "start-this.cmd" and or Microsoft Code as launch and debug configuration (it's in VSCode's launch.json file as entry) .

## tech notes on code style

the code is quite un-refined for now .
meant to be fun to write and it's an exploration .
