# ball : simple gravity , bouncing and rotative friction

## usage instructions

use the mouse or touch to grab and drag the ball ,
to make it bounce and rotate by friction .
simulated gravity is there also .
also energy decay is there to make it stop .
so the bouncing stops by decay ,
and roto-traslation also similarly .

## tech notes on code style

the code is quite un-refined for now .
meant to be fun to write and it's an exploration .
